  <h1>Tkinter Snake Game</h1>

  <p>This game application is wholly made with python and the Tkinter framework. In this, we create a plain black background screen with snake boxes and a scoreboard.</p>

  <img src="snake-game.png" alt="Snake Game Screenshot">

  <p>Here the food is served at random on the screen. So when the snake eats the food, the score is incremented to 1.</p>

  <p>Here all the characters are created in class and added to code through multiple objects. Also, the high score is stored in text file. If any cracks the highest score, then it automatically overrides the file.</p>
